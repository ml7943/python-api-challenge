# python-api-challenge

The WeatherPy folder contains the tasks for Module 6. 

This folder consists of two main sections: "code" and "output_data." 

The "code" section includes two primary code files. To successfully run the code, ensure that you are located in the "/python-api-challenge/WeatherPy/Code" directory; otherwise, the output might not display correctly and may lead to potential bugs.

To execute the code, please input your API key into the "api_keys.py" file located in the "code" folder. 

The results and images will be generated and stored in the "output_data" folder, specifically as "cities.csv," "Fig1" through "Fig4." Additionally, you will find two images named "Step1_map" and "Step5_map." Due to limitations in displaying maps directly on GitHub from the "VacationPy.ipynb" notebook, these screenshots capture the output maps generated in VS Code for reference.
